# Google Login Remake
A **shot-for-shot remake** of the Google Login Page, complete with animations.

**[DEMO](http://couldbejake.github.io/)**

I designed this Google Login Page clone as a challenge to see how close I could make it to the original. At some point I'll get round to animating the password section of the login page, but for now I'm pleased with the result.

** I've redacted the password section to prevent this project being used for phishing **

The **progress bar** can be found at [Material.io](https://material.io/components/progress-indicators/)

**Preview**
