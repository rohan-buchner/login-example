# Google Login Page Clone

A shot-for-shot remake of the Google Login Page, complete with animations.

I designed this Google Login Page clone as a challenge to see how close I could make it to the original. At some point I'll get round to animating the password section of the login page, but for now I'm pleased with the result.
